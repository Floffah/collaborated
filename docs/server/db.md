# Databases

There is no strict schema/structure that databases should conform to. However, the structure that official implementations use is currently defined in [schema.prisma](/packages/server-js/prisma/schema.prisma).

The only structural requirements are that the data held should be able to return information that is required by the [graphql schema](api.md#graphql)
