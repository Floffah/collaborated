## "Hand side project drawer"

I am no psychologist nor do I know anything about how people think (or want to) so correct me if I am wrong.

In a lot of other services, any kind of vertical "navigation" bar that is usually on every main page is on the left.
Although this is good because its fixed, I also feel it gives the wrong subconscious message. Let's take Discord for an
example. They have their server list on the left with the channel list then member list on the right. I feel like this
makes people feel more in control of the members and less in control of the structure of their server list and channel
structure (or at least for right-handed people anyway). That is why I decided to have the project list, guild list, and
channel list on the right with members as a pop-out or separate page (undecided). This is to give more of a subconscious
message that you are in control of your projects/groups/channels and not in control of what people do there. Remember
that I don't know what I'm talking about this just sounds rational to me. However, if someone is left-handed, they can
enable left-handed mode which will flip these around.
