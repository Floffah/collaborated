# Discrete Modal
This is a modal/popup that is meant to not be the main center of attention. It is currently only used to ask contributors/developers if they want to go into development mode when the api is unreachable.

## Usage
It is fairly simple. The buttons and styles are built in, you just need to tell it what text to display (and how to react to button presses)

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Basic" args={{position: "none"}}>{(args) => <DiscreteModal {...args}/>}</Story>
</Canvas>

## API
<ArgsTable of={DiscreteModal}/>
