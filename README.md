**PLEASE NOTE**

- In this repository, issues should only be created for bug reports. If you have a feature request, question, or
  anything else you want to talk about, use the discussions tab.
- Before you speculate anything about the `server` folder that isn't in packages, please read
  it's [readme](packages/server/README.md)

# Collaborated

```js
// TODO: write readme
```

run `yarn build` for help with the build command

## Developers

- Please make sure when developing, your IDE or code editor has prettier support. If using intellij or webstorm, make
  sure you have the prettier plugin installed. This project has idea configs in the repo so it should automatically
  configure when using this project.

See a list of planned/implemented features [here](features.md)

When testing and on Windows 10 with Windows Terminals installed (the build command detects this) it is recommended to
pass `--exclude web` to the `yarn build dev` command and run `yarn workspace @collaborated/web next dev` separately so
it is easier to see.

If you are on linux or don't have Windows Terminals installed, the build command runs everything in parallel in
development mode.

run `yarn build` for more information

### Branches

- `master` - This is where all pull requests and edits should be sent to. Can be tested
  at https://master.capp.floffah.dev
- `beta` - Every time master is at a point where it needs to be tested in "production" but without breaking anything,
  master will be merged into beta. Can be tested at https://beta.capp.floffah.dev
- `production` - This is the production branch that vercel pushes to https://capp.floffah.dev
