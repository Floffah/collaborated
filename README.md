## Warnings
 - When using the manager, make sure you:
	1. use a prebuilt
	2. if developing it, write as much as you can then test because it takes a while to compile (on windows w/msys2 mingw64 atleast)
	
## Building the manager
1. Run `go install -v -x -a -i` in capp_root/services/manager (you only need to this once, this saves the build command from building libraries every time)
2. Run `yarn manager` to build it

### "Invalid flag in pkg-config" err
Go to PKG_CONFIG_PATH/gdk-3.0.pc and PKG_CONFIG_PATH/gdk-2.0.pc (these will have -win32- in the middle on windows, make sure to change it in all 4) and remove the -Wl, flag (make sure to remove the comma after too)
On windows I found this in wherever_mingw64/32_is/lib/pkgconfig (in my case it was C:/msys2/mingw64/lib/pkgconfig

Once you have corrected this you may need to rerun the install and manager command to make sure the build is correct
