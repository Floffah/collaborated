## Project Drawer
I have a vision of the ui of the project list where it is a vertical thin bar on the right which can be expanded by an mdi icon. The reason i want it to be on the right is because it feels more natural i think since to people who are right handed it will feel more natural and "at their fingertips". Eventually there will also be a left-handed mode which should have support for at the start but not have much functionality beyond this until suggestions are received.
The reason i call it the project "drawer" is just because of the fact it will feel natural and when clicking on one of the circles or "handle"/"knobs"s it will pull out giving more information in a drawer style.
