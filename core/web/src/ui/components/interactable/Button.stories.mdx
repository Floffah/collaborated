# Button

One of the most used elements in a website. This is Collaborated's take on it.

## Usage

The most basic use is a button of type default. This is that button.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Default">{(args) => <Button {...args}>Button</Button>}</Story>
</Canvas>

But there are different types of buttons. Here is what the `primary` button looks like.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Primary" args={{type: "primary"}}>{(args) => <Button {...args}>Primary</Button>}</Story>
</Canvas>

There's more... There is different sizes.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Big-enough" args={{type: "primary", size: "medium"}}>{(args) => <Button {...args}>Big-enough</Button>}</Story>
    <Story name="Too Big"    args={{type: "primary", size: "large" }}>{(args) => <Button {...args}>Too Big   </Button>}</Story>
</Canvas>
